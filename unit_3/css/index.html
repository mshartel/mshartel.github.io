    <p>Maggie's Jewelry brings you the highest quality gemstone jewelry at affordable prices. I use natural stones with the least amount of "fussing with" as possible, which means, except for my love-affair with candy jade, I don't purchase anything altered by dye. Heat yes, dye, nope. I can't help the heating, it happens before I can get to any of the gemstones.</p>
